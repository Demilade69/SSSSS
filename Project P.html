            <p class="p">I always like to think of you as a very close friend even when I don't show it as much,
                and I will most definately work on that. Which is why I made this to thank you and tell you how
                much I care about our friendship and spending time with you (I mean in the presence of the Lord almighty). 
                I realized I should have said all this sooner but nonetheless we should
                make of most of now and do what we can while we can.
                <br>And with this I hope I've been able to convince and not confuse you that I care about you and you matter to me.
                (Chill small I can see your head getting bigger from here) and I hope you also share the same, otherwise, I'd still remain Unchanged.</br>

            <p class="p-3">This page I made for you isn't just to tell you how much I <i>love you</i> but to also tell you how amazing you are.<br/>
                <span class="span-2"><hr color="red"/><span class="span-2">It's been a while since we've known each other but it's mostly on surface level. Only until recently have I gotten to know you better.
                 There's still a lot I don't know about you, but from the little I know, It's hard not to become fond of you. Every chance I get to spend time with you always reminds me of just how beautiful you are in
                 nature, I always enjoy your company which is why you're my favourite person to hang out with, no cap. I hope to be able to spend more time with you and get to 
                 know you better and become closer.
                <hr color="red"/><span class="span-2">There's so many reasons why I think you're amazing and for one it's that you make for a really good companion and somehow it's never dull
                being around you and also let's face it, your smile is one that can easily brighten anyone's day, it's hard not to stare all the time.
                here's more to say but I'll just keep going on and on so I might just end it here for now.</span>
